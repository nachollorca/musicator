## Musicator

A fun little project where I attempt to classify songs within 10 music genres discussing different methods, from random forests to simple neural networks.

The code is all set to run in order in the notebook `main.ipynb`. At the very end, you can use your own wav files to infer the genre! 

Just download the GTZAN dataset from [the official site](http://marsyas.info/) and place its contents into the `data` directory.
